Static Meshes

Pivot points for static meshes must be set correctly before importing (probably while creating).

IMPORTANT!!

Don't rename socket as soon as it's created, UE Editor will freak out!
Use the preview static mesh to place the socket first, then clear the preview and only rename once cleared.
