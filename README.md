Created as part of Ben Tristem's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/) on C++ with the Unreal engine.

## Usage
You're free to use any part of this project for any use whatsoever, subject to the license. There's probably a few hundred different examples of the same thing on Github and I'm not sure what purpose you'd get out of it, but go for it.
