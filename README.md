# 04_BattleTank
Open world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain and advanced control systems in UE4.

## Purpose
Created as part of Ben Tristem's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/) on C++ with the Unreal engine.

## Usage
You're free to use any part of this project for any use whatsoever, subject to the license. Please be aware that the Unreal Engine is required to run the project and is subject to its own licenses, not covered by this project.
There's probably a few hundred different examples of the same thing on Github and I'm not sure what purpose you'd get out of it, but go for it.
